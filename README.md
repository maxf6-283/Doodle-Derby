# Welcome to Doodle Derby!

To play, visit [www.doodlederby.com](https://www.doodlederby.com)!
Please Note: Doodle Derby is currently only **compatible on a computer/laptop.** Playing on a phone or tablet is known to cause issues with gameplay.

## How to Play

Start by creating a lobby and inviting at least two friends!

The game will begin by everyone writing word prompts that are drawable. They can be simple, like “apple pie,” or more personal to your friend group, like “Allie’s cat.” 

After everybody has submitted words, the drawing will begin! 
If you are an artist, draw your prompt accurately and quickly to win the round. 
If you are in the audience, try to guess both artists’ prompts (they’re different!). Faster guesses = more points. 

At the end of the game, a winner will be declared. __Let’s doodle!__
